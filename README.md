Project Name: To Do App

This project is a task management system that organizes tasks based on their priority, helping users focus on what matters most. Each task includes a description, a priority level, and a time to complete or start the task at. Tasks are stored in a custom MaxHeap priority queue, ensuring that the highest-priority task is always shown first. The interface allows users to add tasks, view the most urgent task, and complete tasks as they work through them. Task entries are also color-coded by priority, giving a clear visual understanding of urgency at a glance. The priority level goes from 1 being the lowest to 10 being the highest.

This app is designed for students, professionals, or anyone looking for a simple and efficient way to manage their daily tasks. Whether you're juggling multiple deadlines or just trying to stay organized, this app helps you sort, prioritize, and complete tasks seamlessly.
